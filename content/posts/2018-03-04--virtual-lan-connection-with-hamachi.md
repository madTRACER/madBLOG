Some days before I needed to create Virtual LAN connection with my friend’s computer. Actually, we could use OpenVPN, but sometimes it’s hard to set it up on Windows. So I needed to use Hamachi.

I installed Hamachi on my computer (use Software Manager or direct link <https://www.vpn.net/>), but it is so hard to use it in Terminal so I started to search a GUI client. I found Haguichi which is working like Hamachi client on Windows.

You can download it in Software Manager in Arch or on the official site [ https://www.haguichi.net/](https://www.haguichi.net/) .

After the installation you have to launch Haguighi, set some details and create or join to the group. Then you can use it as a LAN connection.
