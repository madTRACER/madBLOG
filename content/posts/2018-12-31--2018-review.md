It’s very popular to summarize every year in the end of December. Thus, I am trying to recall all memories and important things happened with me during this year.

This year was important for me, because I graduated from my school and I was needed to choose university. I really wanted to study abroad, because our country still needs to keep abreast with neuroscience, where I want to improve myself. I was preparing for SAT, but, unfortunately, I didn’t try to pass them due to circumstances. I also wanted to apply for Russian universities (MIPT and IFMO) and also prepared for it, but I couldn’t leave my country to pass the exam. In the end of June I understood that I need to pass UNT (United National Test) to apply for local university. I had choice between KBTU (Kazakh-British Technical University) and IITU (International IT University). I passed UNT for 109/140 and sent an application to IITU, where I’m studying now. I think it’s the best university for programmers in Kazakhstan, but I don’t really like it, so I definitely need to study myself.

This year I really improved my technical skills. I learned how to use *Altium Designer* and started to use *KiCad*. I also improved my skills in programming, started to use *STM32*. I hope, I will review my projects soon and post about them. I started a big project, where I will use a lot new solutions and techniques and I will also tell about them here, when I will get my laptop from service.

I’ve started to watch and follow [@linguamarina](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAQg09FkoobmLquNNoO4ulg). She is a great person, who inspires me to improve myself and to climb to my dream! Thank you so much [@linguamarina](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAQg09FkoobmLquNNoO4ulg)! I think you will achieve all your goals!

I don’t have enough time, but I took some to read new [@scinquisitor](https://scinquisitor.livejournal.com/)’s book “*Defence against the Dark Art”**.* I played some games – *Witcher 3, God of War, Fallout 4*. However, I really want to play *Detroit : Become Human* and *Red Dead Redemption 2*, and I’m waiting for *Cyberpunk 2077*.

This year I started **madTRACER** as a lifestyle and I hope to study more about technologies and neuroscience to implement my ideas about neural interfaces and help people with physical disabilities next year.

I think that I forgot something about this year, but it is not so important. I hope to visit the country, where a lot of technologies were invented and developed – the United States. I particularly want to visit San Francisco and Silicon Valley.

Next year I’m planning to contribute more in open-source projects on GitHub and GitLab and create them. Today my graph doesn’t look great, but later – more.

Thank you 2018! Let’s stay tuned for that and do our best.
