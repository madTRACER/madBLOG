Sorry for a big delay, friends. Today I want to tell you about my new university. As you may know I really wanted to study abroad but I lost this opportunity because of some circumstances such as lack of money and bad level of our school education.

That is why I passed our Unified National Test and applied to the IITU (International IT University). I’ve been studying there for 2 months and I can actually say that our university must be the best in IT sphere in our country. At all it obviously has a lot of flaws because it’s not a MIT, Stanford etc. By the way, I still hope to go to the US through students exchange programs, such as Global UGRAD and also get a graduate/master degree from MIT.

On the other hand we always have a lot of opportunities to study ourselves via the Internet resources, books and experienced people. For me, university (except the best in the world) is just a way to get a degree diploma. I always think that we need to find our way and improve ourselves in that direction. For me it’s embedded systems based on MCU, robotics, bionics and working on neurointerfaces as the big future plan.

Thus, I want to say about the biggest problem of our world for me – our society. When I see to people who is studying with me I notice that the majority of them don’t actually want to become the specialists in IT sphere and they went to study there just because of somebody advice or sermon. Most of them are looking at billionaires in IT sphere and looking at the trends of it and want to become one of this successful people. In my opinion, I think that people shouldn’t go to the sphere because of trends or money only. It needs to be thought by yourself. For example, today AI direction is very popular but it has a lot of aspects to discuss so I hope I ever write about it.

In the end I suggest you to think about it all and make some conclusions from all above. Bye!
