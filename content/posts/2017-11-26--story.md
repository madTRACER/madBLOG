For the start of my blog, I want to tell you short story about me – person who can’t live without science and technologies.

It all began when I was 5 years old. I started to learn Windows, and when I went to the 1<sup>st</sup> grade I had known all simple programs, like Paint, WordPad etc. Up to 7<sup>th</sup> grade, my favorite subject was Math.

By the way, I have interested in it since that time.

Some time later, people started to buy smartphones on the Android. This platform opened new opportunities for me that my computer did not have.

In the 7<sup>th</sup> grade we started our physics course and it became my second favorite subject. At that time my acquaintance with the greatest science passed.

10<sup>th</sup> grade… I met my best friend, who loves science and technologies like me. I have interested in “Venus Project” since that time.

Presently, I want to study at university for the Robotics (Electronic) Engineer.

Surely, I’m superposing my hobby and education, so I’m learning MC and platforms for projects on their base (Arduino, NodeMCU etc.)

I felt nice to share self-information with you. Visit my website as it will be so many interesting information and projects…
