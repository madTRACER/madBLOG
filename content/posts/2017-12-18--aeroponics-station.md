#### **First Arduino project or How we wanted to grow some strawberry at home. Part 1**

**Construction of the body.** At first we created the project in the CAD program and bought nessesary materials: PVC, hoses and car parts (washer noozles and water pomp). Some days later, we started to create in real life and finished main construction in two days.  
*Used materials:*  
1\) Sheet of PVC 200x300cm *x2*  
2\) Noozles for car window washer *x8*  
3\) Hoses for car window washer *600cm x1*  
4\) Water pomp with tank for car window washer *x1*

**Electronics.** After some days I received Arduino and some electronic parts at the post office and then we created electronic water pomp control. It was just Arduino, relay module, RTC module and power supply. Code for the project is also very simple, but you can find it on [my Github](https://github.com/madTRACER).  
*Used materials:*  
1\) Arduino Nano R3 *x1*  
2\) Relay Module 1 Channel for Arduino *x1*  
3\) RTC DS3231 for Arduino *x1*  
4\) 12V 3A + 5V 8A Power Supply *x1*

Now I don’t have enough time to grow something. However, I want to continue this project later. **To be continued…**
